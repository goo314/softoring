# Softoring

**Softoring** is a combination of **Software** and **Mentoring**, representing a school software mentoring program I joined as a **mentee**.

This repository is a record of my journey in problem solving, algorithm fundamentals, and applied software development. It reflects how I grew in my ability to think computationally, break down problems, and write efficient, readable code.


## What I Learned

### ðŸ“Œ Core Algorithmic Thinking
- Developed a strong foundation in **dynamic programming**, including how to optimize recursive problems into bottom-up approaches.
- Applied **greedy strategies**, **two-pointer techniques**, and **binary search** to reduce time complexity.
- Practiced **breadth-first search (BFS)** for shortest path and state transition problems.
- Understood the use of **prefix sums** and **space compression** for efficient array and matrix queries.
- Learned to recognize **Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)** and **Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS)** patterns across diverse problems.

### ðŸ“Œ Complexity & Optimization
- Evaluated algorithm efficiency using **time and space complexity analysis**.
- Practiced converting naÃ¯ve solutions (e.g., O(nÂ³)) into optimized versions (e.g., O(n log n)).
- Focused on the importance of pre-sorting, cumulative caching, and memoization.

### ðŸ“Œ Problem Solving Habits
- Built structured approaches before coding, such as drawing diagrams, writing pseudo-code, and identifying edge cases.
- Improved debugging skills and learned to validate with small test cases.
- Analyzed multiple strategies per problem to find the most efficient one.

### ðŸ“Œ Real-World Application
- Practiced **Kakao coding test-style problems**, which emphasize both algorithmic and implementation accuracy.
- Explored **Android app development** with Android Studio.
- Learned the basics of **OCR** for text extraction.
- Applied software skills to real data via public datasets ([data.go.kr](https://www.data.go.kr/)).
